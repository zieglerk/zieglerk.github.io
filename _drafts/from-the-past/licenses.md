Meta-Diclaimer: This topic is a legal mine field, so please keep our disclaimer in mind.

There's usually two angles
1. use (e.g. in a presentation/collection)
2. modification (adaptation/remix)
For one example, some software licenses allow the use, but not the
modification of software. For another example, some image licenses
require any modification (remix) to be released under a similar license.


We discuss licensing in the context of
1. text and images (also: audios and videos)
2. software

# Use Case: use somebody else's CC-picture in your blog

We are using, but not remixing other people's work. (This may change,
when you want to issue a "printed" version of your blog?!)

All CC-licenses are OK

An example that I saw as image-caption:

    <Title> (CC BY-SA 2.0 (linked to license) by <author> (linked to source on flickr))

and then locally store a medium sized version in `image` and set the
`url` attribute to the flickr-share-link.

## Sources for CC

Mo Sauer hat
[hier](https://magazin.phlow.de/bild/quellen-kostenloses-foto-bild-material/)
eine Liste zusammengestellt.

## For perspective

CC BY-SA is also the most common licensce and there's more stats on the
[state of the commons](https://stateof.creativecommons.org/).


# Software

At the top of my head, my first choice is GPLv2 omitting the clause "and later
versions" (like the Linux kernel, because the GPLv3 seems like a real
SNAFU).

Some people opt for the/an (?) Apache License, because it's suppossed to
be better compatible with commercial interests. (Source?) Question:
which is better compatible with scientific interests?

# Text and Images

For text (documentation), we use CC BY-SA, like wikipedia. (Stay away from the GNU FDL,
because the invariant-clause is non-free and the DRM-clause is badly
written.)

Examples for CC-license

and how to mention the source, when you modify them (i.e. generate
derivative work)

# Music

There is some great creative-commons music, e.g. playing on
Chaosradio.

Latest addition: [Beyond Skyrim: Brumo OST](https://danielran.com/blog/beyond-skyrim-bruma-ost) by Daniel Ran is licensed
[CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). Thanks.


## Use Case: publish a text/image of your own on the internet

## My Choice

For texts and images, we use CC BY-SA. (Alternatively, CC BY.)

## VG Wort et al

In Germany, there used to be a "Rahmenvertrag for Paragraph 52a UrhG"
dealing with the re-use of copy-righted material for educational
purposes. You can ignore all these commercial and legal shenanigans by
choosing material from the Public Domain, Creative Commons, and Open
Access. Do it!

## Context: on the rule/impact of good/bad licencsing and DRM

[DRM is toxic to culture](https://meshedinsights.com/2017/07/09/drm-is-toxic-to-culture/)

TODO add this movie about the cultural "blackout" because it's
impossible to find the license holders for lots material used in
documentary films -- even for the director of the films who want to
release a new edition on DVD (for which they need to clear the rights again).

The Free Software Foundation runs the campaign
[Defective By Design](https://www.defectivebydesign.org/) to support
DRM-free environments.

## Others

The U.S. Department of State has issued an
[Open Licensing Playbook](https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2017/01/267125.htm)
(under CC0-license!) for recommendations ("plays") on publishing
grant-supported material, especially educational. (Source:
