Speakers: Manu & Armin

# Equipment

## Target

- your vest (in particular the shoulder pads)
- your tagger
- NB: the vest and the tagger are blinking constantly; keep that in
  mind, when hiding

## Tagger

- may support different firing frequencies  (like manual, semi-automatic, automatic)
- the laser may be visible thanks to to the smoke.

## Clothing

- wear dark sports gear
- optionally: warpaint/eyeshadow

# Environment

- The building/architecture is usually more constrained and crooked
  than a paintball arena
- Common Rule: no running, but you may rob and move around quickly

## Power-Ups/Buffs

hitting special targets may offer
- extra shield
- rapid fire
- faster respawn

moving through specially colored gates may offer
- power-ups/death/nothing

# Roles

- flusher (against fortified positions): ~~run~~ walk in, get killed, wait and
  threaten until respawn
- weasel (against calm campers): move around randomly and quickly for distraction
- core (to limit others' manoeuvrability and gain oversight): camp
  somewhere in the center
- double trouble: form a team of two (small guy, tall guy) and clear
  space together (e.g. alternating left and right)

# Gameplay

- you respawn 5 seconds after getting hit; use this time to move
  around freely and/or keep track of your opponents
- Is ganking a thing? -- Yes, but it sucks. As usual.

# Meta

- Stay calm and move slowly. (Exceptions see above)
- If there is a first floor: go there and stay there.
- Don't run too much -- in particular, don't run into wide open spaces.
