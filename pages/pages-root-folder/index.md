I am a researcher, teacher, and administrator with interests in
information hiding and retrieval. So, I do cryptography and machine
learning. My [research]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/research.md
%}) page offers more detailed descriptions. I also enjoy the
occasional game theory and play volleyball.

You can find my articles under [publications]({{ site.baseurl }}{%
link pages/publications.md %}) and the accompanying python programs
under [software]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/software.md %}). My
courses and presentations are filed under [teachings]({{ site.baseurl
}}{% link pages/teaching.md %}) and [talks]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link
pages/talks.md %}), respectively. There's also a [blog]({{
site.baseurl }}{% link blog/index.html %}) with random snippets of
information (FAQs & HOWTOs) and rough notes ("What is ...?").

# History

This is a relaunch of my homepage at
[zieglerk.net](http://zieglerk.net) using jekyll instead of
pure-html. Most of the static content is in English (legacy), while the
blogging has gradually moved to German.

Previous verisons of these pages, were a pure-html page (also hosted
under this URL) and wordpress-blog followed by joint blogging at
[Passau Graduate Student Brown Bag Seminar (PGBBS)](https://pgbbs.github.io).
