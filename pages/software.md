I host some code, mostly in python, on [github](https://github.com/zieglerk). Most of it is joint work with co-authors (and
		co-teachers).

## Research Code

> Rule 8: The development of fast algorithms is slow!
<cite>Arnold Sch&ouml;nhage</cite>

Academic software has some peculiarities. A Dagstuhl
	    Perspectives Workshop addressed them with a <a href="http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2017/7146/">manifesto</a>.

- [`multivariate_polynomials`](https://github.com/zieglerk/multivariate_polynomials): Generating
    Functions for Special Multivariate Polynomials
- [`polynomial_decomposition`](https://github.com/zieglerk/polynomial_decomposition): Decomposing
    Univariate Polynomials over Finite Fields
- [`baby-AES`](https://github.com/zieglerk/baby-AES): Differential
    and Linear Attacks on baby-AES

## Tutorials for Teaching
