# How to install SageMath?

The SageMath project has a complete [installation
guide](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/index.html). For
non-developers, I personally recommend [installation from
conda-forge](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/conda.html). If
you're using Windows and the recommended virtual machine is not an
option for you, there are also [binaries](https://www.sagemath.org/download-windows.html).

# Can you give me a quick introduction?

No, but I can link you to
- a [quick
introduction](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/tutorial/index.html)
(also in [german](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/de/tutorial/))
- [PREP Tutorials](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/prep/index.html)
  for the use of Sage in undergraduate education
- a selection of [Sage Thematic
  Tutorials](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/thematic_tutorials/index.html)
  - and even [More Sage Thematic Tutorials](https://more-sagemath-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

  SageMath](https://www.cryptool.org/download/ctb/CTB-Appendix-SageMath-de.pdf)

# How to load a SageMath-Worksheet?

SageMath-Worksheets used to be a separate file format (ending .sws or
.sagews). These are now simply Jupyter notebooks (ending .ipynb). You
can load them into any Jupyter instance, but to run them, a
sage-kernel needs to be available
