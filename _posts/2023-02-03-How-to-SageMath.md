# How to install SageMath?

The SageMath project has a complete [installation
guide](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/index.html). For
non-developers, I personally recommend [installation from
conda-forge](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/conda.html). If
you're using Windows and the recommended virtual machine is not an
option for you, there are also [binaries](https://www.sagemath.org/download-windows.html).

# Can you give me a quick introduction?

I can link you to [quick introduction](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/tutorial/index.html).

can load them into any Jupyter instance, but to run them, a
sage-kernel needs to be available
