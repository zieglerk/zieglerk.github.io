teaser: "The default template for posts and pages aligns the page beautifully in the middle. <strong>But</strong> you can customize posts/pages easily via switches in the front matter to <em>get a sidebar</em> and/or to <em>turn off meta-information</em> at the end of the page like categories, tags and dates."
meta_teaser: "This is an example of a beautiful aligned post in the middle. There is no sidebar to distract the reader. The difference to the Page-Template is, that you find meta-information at the bottom of the post."

How to work in a group, here: how to write emails

- "After three, we talk"
- Matt Might, [How to send and reply to email](https://matt.might.net/articles/how-to-email/)
- ?Randy Pausch?
- Cal Newport, [Beyond the Inbox: Rules for Reducing Email](
  https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2020/04/14/beyond-the-inbox-rules-for-reducing-email/)

- Rule #1: Never schedule a call or meeting using email.
- Rule #2: Immediately move obligations out of your inbox and into
role-specific repositories.
- Rule #3: Hold office hours

In my case, I'll decide pretty quickly whether to finish (or even
start) reading an email. The chances are pretty high, if
- I'm the only one in "To:",
- the "Subject"-line is meaningful, and
- I know what is expected from me after the first paragraph.
